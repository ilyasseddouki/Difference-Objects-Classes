# Difference-Objects-Classes

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the difference between classes and objects in Java.

## Concepts
- A class is a blueprint used to define attributes and behavior.
- An object is an instance of a class, created at runtime and capable of using the methods and properties defined in the class.

## Project Files
- `Car.java` defines the `Car` class with attributes (`make`, `model`, `year`) and a method to display car info.
- `Main.java` contains the `main()` method where we create car **objects** and call their methods.
